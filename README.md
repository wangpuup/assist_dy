This repo is based on [https://github.com/vrenkens/assist/] and contains changes to the original programs. More specifically, this code presents the SLU decoders for dysarthric speech. The inputs of the decoders can be either the MFCC/Fbank features or pre-trained speech representations extracted from the larger-scale acoustic models. The detailed implementations are explained in the paper "Benefits of Pre-trained Mono- and Cross-lingual Speech Representations for Spoken Language Understanding of Dutch Dysarthric Speech".

A project description of the ASSIST project can be found https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi/projects/current/ASSIST. Assist is a speech interface that learns to map spoken commands to a semantic representation. The code is written in Python and most models are built using TensorFlow.
